# Audit

We had a $100k prizepool audit contest conducted by Code4rena. Some of the most talented security researchers in the space dove into the Malt contracts to try find all the issues they could.

You can read the final audit report here: [https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-11-malt/](https://code4rena.com/reports/2021-11-malt/)

A quick breakdown of the findings:
* 5 high risk findings
* 30 medium severity
* 43 low severity

Since then all of these issues have been fixed and many improvements made with direct input from some of the auditors who found the issues in the first place.
