# Auction finalization

Once the auction either reaches the desired amount of bids or the auction reaches the 30 minute mark the auction is ended.

At this point the auction will have raised some amount of money (either the desired amount or less). Based on this amount and the ending price of the auction along with the constraints on reserve usage the protocol will use reserves to buy and burn the premium + potentially more if that is available and favorable.
