# Roadmap

Our main focus right now is to validate that the stability mechanism actually works the way we intended on a single pool. With that said our plan for the future looks something like this:

1. Validate that the stability mechanism works on a single pool
2. Deploy more Malt/stable pools with arb infrastructure
3. Deploy other Malt pools against non stable assets like ETH, WBTC etc
4. Build a Malt lending platform powered by the core protocol
5. Develop an AMM that brings additional power to the Malt stabilizer
6. Multi chain deployments
7. ???
8. Profit
