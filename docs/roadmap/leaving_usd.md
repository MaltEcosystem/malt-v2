# Leaving USD

Pegging to the US dollar is not the end goal of Malt. The US dollar is just the easiest and most common currency to peg to to prove the idea that the Malt mechanism can hold a peg. However, the mechanism itself is agnostic to a given peg. It is possible to peg to anything you can get a reliable data feed for. The Malt mechanism is simply a set of economic incentives that act as a control loop to converge towards a value. There is nothing to say that value has to be anything specific or even that the value has to be static.

There are many drawbacks to pegging to the US dollar, most notably being the rapid devaluing of the currency. In some sense calling a coin pegged to the dollar a “stablecoin” is completely laughable. But as with any big idea, you must start small and simple so starting Malt’s life as a US dollar pegged coin makes the most sense.

Over the long term Malt’s plan is to peg to something that will hold its value through time. True stability. This could be thought of as a peg against buying power. This is a complex thing to address as buying power is different across the world and getting a reliable and accurate data feed for that is also not an easy task. But nothing worth doing is easy so we are ready to tackle this challenge head on.

Building a coin that can hold its purchasing power over time is the holy grail of finance. It is the bedrock of everything else. Holding such a coin guarantees you at least maintain your wealth over time, even in the face of inflation. From there you could imagine earning yield on such a coin. Any yield on that coin would be realised wealth appreciation. You no longer need to seek yield just to keep up.

In a world of hyper-connected defi such a coin that is stable against buying power stands to be the financial primitive at the heart of all other defi use cases. This is what we aim to build. We hope you share our vision and join us in the most exciting journey in financial history.
