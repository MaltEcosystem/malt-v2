# Malt Fund

Building good user experiences is a big part of our world view. The typical user experience in defi is not great. Malt wants to push the envelope on defi user experiences and remove as much friction as possible.

To that end we are working on something called the Malt Fund \(working title\). Malt fund can be thought of as a set it and forget it system for participating in the Malt ecosystem. You could think of it as Yearn vaults for Malt.

The core motivation for this lies in the auction system. As mentioned one of the potential issues with Malt is a lack of engagement with the auctions. Auction participation requires active engagement - you have to monitor when the auctions trigger and then you need to take part when they do.

Malt fund would allow a single deposit to be actively deployed automatically into auctions \(it will work with LP farming too\). This automates the manual work required from the end user perspective as well as providing some guaranteed auction participation removing some tail risk to the protocol.
