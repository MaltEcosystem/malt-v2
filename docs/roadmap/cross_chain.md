# Cross Chain

Malt’s vision is to be a truly decentralized, defi native stablecoin. To fill that position Malt has to exist everywhere that defi exists. This mandates that Malt must be a multi-chain protocol. We are also firmly of the belief that the future is multi-chain. Projects like Polkdadot and Cosmos are moving us in that direction as well as the advent of so many cross chain-bridges.

Shortly after Malt proves itself as a coin that can maintain stability we want to work to become a natively cross chain application. Not simply allowing Malt to be bridged across chains but building native cross chain user experiences directly into the protocol. If you are earning yield on Malt deposited on Ethereum, what is to say you shouldn’t be able to directly withdraw that value to Avalanche or Fantom? Why do you have to withdraw on ETH then bridge it?

These are big questions that the defi community as a whole still hasn’t found good solutions for. Malt doesn’t have the answers yet either. We want to play a role in building the defi future we want to see.
