# Yield when stable

As has been mentioned previously many other stablecoins provide no rewards when the price is very stable over periods of time. This incentivizes price being volatile around peg.

To get around this Malt will provide a fixed yield when the price is stable. The exact amount of yield is set internally on the contract and will be controllable via governance. The fixed yield will be paid in newly minted Malt.

This does create supply increase in times of supply and demand equilibrium which isnâ€™t particularly desirable. This is definitely one area that can be improved upon in future versions of Malt.

This yield paid in malt will skew supply/demand towards the demand side and force the protocol towards auctions. If there is a significant imbalance towards the supply side then successive auctions will need to happen to contract supply sufficiently to find the supply/demand equilibrium again.
