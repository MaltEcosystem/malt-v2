# Token Redemption

The arb tokens are redeemed through profit generation above peg in the same way that LP rewards are created.

When there are outstanding arb tokens to be redeemed and the stabilizer generated profit the breakdown of profit distribution looks like this:

* Same 20% set aside for liquidity extension
* Up to a maximum of 70% of the remaining is used to redeem arb tokens.

If there is anything left after paying off the arbitrage tokens it is split:

* 90% of the remaining profit is distributed to LP stakers
* 5% of the remaining is given to the treasury.
* 5% of the remaining profit is given to the caller that triggered the stabilizing action.
