# Architecture

Now that you have an idea of the general user facing mechanics of the protocol letâ€™s dig into the technical specifics that make all of this possible.

The Malt architecture is split into 3 parts, some of which further break down into smaller units. 1. StabilizerManager 2. PoolStabilizationPod 3. DAO

## Stabilizer Manager

The StabilizerManager is in charge of keeping a track of all PoolStabilizationPods and communicating with them all to coordinate global actions where necessary.

## PoolStabilizationPod

The PoolStabilizationPod is made up of a few smaller pieces all of which contribute towards stabilizing a single AMM pool. Every AMM pool gets its own StabilizationPod to stabilize it. Keeping the stabilization of each pool completely separate from one another reduces overall complexity without giving up much. Arbitrage bots will always keep pools consistent with each other without the need for explicit intervention by the protocol.

This kind of modularity allows for different optimizations to happen to each pool or even different incentives to be added to each pool. The flexibility of each pod being completely self contained is very powerful.

A PoolStabilizationPod contains: 1. Price Oracle 2. Stabilizer Node 3. Liquidity Mine 4. Auction Base

## Price Oracle

The price oracle is the part of the pod that keeps track of the price in the AMM pool the pod is attached to. The oracle will track the TWAP \(time weighted average price\) of the last two epochs \(30mins each\). Epochs do not have the same connotation as they do for other algorithmic stablecoins but that will be elaborated on further below.

Stabilization behaviour is done based on this 2 epoch TWAP. This is done to make it more costly to manipulate the oracle price.

## Stabilizer Node

The stabilizer node is in control of all actions that will actively stabilize the price of the AMM pool. It is also in charge of distributing the profits from the stabilization activity to the Liquidity Mine where the end users farm rewards.

These actions are: 1. Printing fresh malt and selling it via the AMM when price is above the peg price. 2. Triggering an arbitrage auction when below peg.

* It will also use the liquidity extension capital to buy back and burn additional Malt to guarantee supply contraction.

## Liquidity Mine

The liquidity is mine is where participants in the protocol can farm the rewards generated by the Stabilizer Node. By providing liquidity the end user is adding value to the protocol. The more liquidity the protocol has the easier of a job it has to stabilize the pool. In return for the risk these participants take on by providing liquidity they are distributed a share of the profit the protocol generates.

## Auction Base

The auction base is in control of all of the auction mechanics. It handles bids on the auctions and redemption and claiming of arbitrage tokens. It ensures that tokens get redeemed pro-rata and that auctions are redeemed in a FIFO \(First-In First-Out\) manner.
