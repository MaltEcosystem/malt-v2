# Coinbase

Coinbase is a convenient option, especially for users in the US, Canada, UK and Europe.

Sending Fiat in your account typically is a bank transfer with low or no fees.

1. Register in Coinbase; this automatically registers the same account into CoinbasePro, the trader version of Coinbase which charges less fees for crypto trades

2. Deposit fiat in CoinbasePro [https://pro.coinbase.com/](https://pro.coinbase.com/) \(if you verify with ID\) or Coinbase \(you can transfer funds from Coinbase to CoinbasePro free of charge\).

   Help how to do that, see Funding your account section: [https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/managing-my-account](https://help.coinbase.com/en/pro/managing-my-account)

3. Purchase ETH - this is the most fool proof token to buy, as you will be paying gas in ETH. You can swap ETH to anything later when you have bridged it to ETH on Matic.

   Select the correct Fiat - ETH market and purchase [https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-GBP)

From here, there are a few options.

### Buy Matic directly from CoinbasePro

2. Obtain the Crypto address from AscendEx: [https://ascendex.com/en/assets/assets-recharge/MATIC](https://ascendex.com/en/assets/assets-recharge/MATIC) &gt; Copy the MATIC\(Polygon\) Deposit Address
3. Paste this into the CoinbasePro transaction window, fill in amounts, then click Withdrawal

5. Once the Matic token is in your wallet you can swap it for other tokens on Quickswap, see [Matic coin exchange on Quickswap](coinbase.md)

### Buy USDC in CoinbasePro and send to AscendEx

This is ideal when sending smaller amounts than the minimum Matic allowed to send from Coinbase.

The process is the same as with Matic above, just pick USDC instead of Matic where relevant.
