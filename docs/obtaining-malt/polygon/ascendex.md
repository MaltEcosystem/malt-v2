# AscendEx

AscendEx \(formerly Bitmax\) is a crypto exchange allowing direct withdrawals into the Matic network.

Feels for withdrawal to Matic are typically lower than using a Bridge.

Note: you must be registered for at least 24 hours before you are allowed to withdraw funds.

They also allow some crypto token purchases directly via card payment \(with a 2% fee charge\).
