# Auction active
From here the auction just runs. It accepts bids and those bids will go towards replenishing the reserves used for the pre-commitment until it has been fully repaid and then from there any bids on the auction will immediately purchase Malt from the AMM and burn it.

Part of the beauty of this mechanism is that as bids come in the Malt market price is being forced up which increases the premium above simply buying Malt to swing trade it back to peg. The auction price is dropping and the Malt market price is increasing. This should incentivise swing traders to consider buying the arbitrage tokens instead.

A further incentive is because the protocol automatically redeems the arb tokens for $1 each traders are effectively guaranteed a limit execution at peg.
